# Speed Detector

# DESCRIPTION
In this folder 1 challenge has been tackled:
            1.  Challenge 2 - Speed Detector
-It is an application that allows a user to input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.  If the driver gets more than 12 points, the application prints: “License suspended”.
