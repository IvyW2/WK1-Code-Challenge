To get started, run the code on a console. User will be promted to enter the speed of the car.If the car speed is less than 70 Km/h then an slert will pop up saying "OK". Otherwise, if the speed is greater than 70km/h the the input will be initiated as i and go through the loop as long as the carspeed is less than 140 km/h. Otherwise any input greater or equal to 140 will directly alert "License suspended". 
For every 5 km/s above the speed limit 70 km/h, it should give the driver one demerit point. The loop continues till 12 points afterwards it returns "
"LICENSE SUSPENDED!!!!!!" as well.
