# Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

## Description
The program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

## Project Setup
To get started, run the code on a console. User will be promted to enter the speed of the car.If the car speed is less than 70 Km/h then an slert will pop up saying "OK". Otherwise, if the speed is greater than 70km/h the the input will be initiated as i and go through the loop as long as the carspeed is less than 140 km/h. Otherwise any input greater or equal to 140 will directly alert "License suspended". 
For every 5 km/s above the speed limit 70 km/h, it should give the driver one demerit point. The loop continues till 12 points afterwards it returns "
"LICENSE SUSPENDED!!!!!!" as well.
